# E-Farm Fullstack Challenge

## The Challenge

Build a UI that displays the **top 10 stories of hackernews**, and **intersperse sponsored messages every 3 stories**.

- Make use of the public [hackernews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).
- You can find the entry point into the frontend in `src/frontend/App.tsx`, and
  into the backend in `src/backend/server.ts`.
- Get the sponsored messages from the backend API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Some Tips

- **Keep it simple**. Focus on solving the challenge before making your code
  beautiful or fast. Time flies fast.
- **Look up things you don't know or remember**. Show us your google-foo!
- **Use libraries and tools that you know and make you fast**. You don't have
  to write things from scratch. If you know a good library to solve a problem,
  use it!

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the frontend in dev mode.
